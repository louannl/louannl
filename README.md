## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lou, here's a little bit about me:

### ðŸ’¬ Why do I code? ...

When I was working as an accountant, I always enjoyed the technical software side of things as opposed to the rest of the job. 
I took part in CPD (Continuing Professional Development) events that were mainly to do with the new technology accountants will be using in the future, and quickly found the software more interesting than the job! (Albeit I'll admit I did enjoy a lot of accounting in general, I'm easily entertained). 

I designed spreadsheets in MS Excel using IF statements and Lookups etc. to automate a lot of my work - I then realised that there's a better way to do this sort of thing - by programming with a language! And I could do it for a living.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
I'm currently looking for a full-time job or work experience in software development! 
In order to do that I have my porftolio projects I am working on: 
- Meal Planner (NodeJs, React, ORM), an website to help manage your weekly shop!
- DogHouseKustoms (Re-designed from HTML/CSS to React), a website for my brother's business idea!
- Uni Takeaway (Re-design of an existing site), a redesign of a family friend's website!
Any help or feedback will be gratefully appreciated!

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
A lot! Even if I've already made a project with a certain framework or language, there is still much more to learn about it!
- NodeJS 
- Python
- React
- React Frameworks
- CSS Frameworks (Tailwind)

### ðŸ¤” My next learning ideas ...
Of course this may change in the future:
- Golang 
I love the Documentation and the idea of using a different concept (concurrency rather than asyncronous)
- Docker 

I've covered the basics of Docker, with Kubernetes
- Typescript 

Might as well do more Javascript!
- Testing 

Getting proficient at unit-testing and test driven development

### âš¡ A little bit about me outside of coding: ...
- I'm a qualified Chartered Accountant
- I enjoy going bouldering in the evenings!
- I play video games, most of the time with friends (co-op, simulators are my favourites)
