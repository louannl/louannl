## Hi there 👋
I'm Lou, here's a little bit about me:

- I'm a career switcher 🔄 , previously being in the accounting industry as a finance controller for a small firm (I currently still hold chartered status)
- I like automation 🤖, which is what pushed me into development
- I have a bunch of house plants 🪴 and I enjoy sports 🏒 🧗‍♀️

### 🔭 I’m currently working on...
I'm currently a full-time Junior software developer @ Veygo Uk 🚙

I still work on my projects in my spare time, but at the moment I am focusing on courses to further develop the skills I need in my current role.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
A lot! Even if I've already made a project with a certain framework or language, there is still much more to learn about it!
- Python / Django / Flask
- Serverless (AWS Lambda)
- other AWS services generally: API Gateway, EC2 etc
- Testing concepts and design
...and much more, I try to focus on what I need to work on that will benefit me the most at current; in between this, I spend time on my projects which use different tech stacks to above, so my skills don't get tooo rusty.

### 🤔 My next learning ideas ...
Of course this may change in the future 🤷:
- Golang 
    - I love the Documentation and the idea of using a different concept (concurrency rather than asyncronous)
- Continous integration / deployment

### Stack
- Backend
    - JS / ES6 / NodeJs
    - Python / Django / Flask
- Infrastructure
    - Docker
    - Circle CI
    - New Relic (Logging)
- Frontend
    - React
    - CSS Frameworks: Tailwind
