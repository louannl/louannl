## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lou, here's a little bit about me:

### ðŸ’¬ Why do I code? ...

When I was working as an accountant, I always enjoyed the technical software side of things as opposed to the rest of the job. 
I took part in CPD (Continuing Professional Development) events that were mainly to do with the new technology accountants will be using in the future, and quickly found the software more interesting than the job! (Albeit I'll admit I did enjoy a lot of accounting in general, I'm easily entertained). 

I designed spreadsheets in MS Excel using IF statements and Lookups etc. to automate a lot of my work - I then realised that there's a better way to do this sort of thing - by programming with a language! And I could do it for a living.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
I'm currently a full-time Junior software developer @ Veygo Uk ðŸš™

I still work on my projects in my spare time, but at the moment I am focusing on courses to further develop the skills I need in my current role.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
A lot! Even if I've already made a project with a certain framework or language, there is still much more to learn about it!
- Python / Django / Flask
- JS / Nodejs / Typescript
- React / Redux
- CSS Frameworks / Tailwind
- Docker / Orchestration systems (e.g. Kubernetes)
- Serverless (AWS Lambda)
- other AWS services generally: API Gateway, EC2 etc.

### ðŸ¤” My next learning ideas ...
Of course this may change in the future ðŸ¤·:
- Golang 
    
    I love the Documentation and the idea of using a different concept (concurrency rather than asyncronous)

- Testing 

  Getting more proficient at unit-testing and test driven development

- Continous integration / deployment 
- AWS

### âš¡ A little bit about me outside of coding: ...
- I'm a qualified Chartered Accountant, and am currently maintaining this
- I enjoy bouldering in my spare time!
- I play video games, most of the time with friends (co-op and simulators are my favourites)
